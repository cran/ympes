Description: Provides a collection of lightweight helper functions (imps) both
  for interactive use and for inclusion within other packages. These include
  minimal assertion functions with a focus on informative error messaging for
  both missing and incorrect function arguments as well as other functions for
  visualising colour palettes, quoting user input and working with age
  intervals.
